0.4 - 2011-12-29
	* important
		- You now must use Rhino 1.R3 (or later). 
	      Earlier Rhino versions simply fail to parse new CoffeeScript compiler.
		  If you get 'missing name after . operator' exception, it means that 
		  an older Rhino library is somewhere on your classpath.  
		 
	* major
		
		- LessCSS is upgraded from 1.1.3 to 1.1.5 
		  see 
		    https://github.com/cloudhead/less.js/compare/42556109588c71762334e7d984d365f82ef984c0...bf73ee7c6840fe5da50527283507e27528313681 
		  
		- CoffeeScript is upgraded from 1.1.2 to 1.2.0.
		  see 
		    http://coffeescript.org/#changelog
		  	https://github.com/jashkenas/coffee-script/compare/1.1.2...1.2.0
		  	
		- CTX_PATH variable is now added to *.less files.
		- You can now customise configuration of module with new 
		  t5conduit.coffee-suffix, t5conduit.less-suffix, t5conduit.less-ctx-path-var-name
		  variables.

    * minor
    	- Error messages from Less compiler should be now slightly more readable. 		       
		
	* internal
		- Unchanged Less compiler file is now used, making future upgrades easier.
		- Internal 'global scope' objects used by transformers are now pooled, 
		  avoiding a bottleneck of a single synchronized block during resource compilation,
		  hopefully making the application more responsive in development on multi-core machines.
